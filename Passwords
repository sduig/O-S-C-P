In order to unshadow to the two files we need to execute

unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > unshadowed.txt


Which will store in the unshadowed.txt file the following

root:$6$riekpK4m$uBdaAyK0j9WfMzvcSKYVfyEHGtBfnfpiVbYbzbVmfbneEbo0wSijW1GQussvJSk8X1M56kzgGj8f7DFN1h4dy1:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

Next and final step is to actually start the cracking with John. It is up to you which cracking method you will chose, though a bruteforcing using a wordlist is usually enough for CTFs. An example attack using a wordlist would be launched like below

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt unshadowed.txt

LINUX SHA512

John The Ripper
john --format=sha512crypt /home/user/pass.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/rockyou.txt

Hashcat
hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 /home/user/pass.txt wordlist=/usr/share/rockyou.txt
